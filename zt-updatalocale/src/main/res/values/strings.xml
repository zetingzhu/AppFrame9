Investors open positions, and \'take profit\' and \"stop loss\" are set automatically. If your prediction is correct, the price hits \'take profit\' and then you will get profits. On the other hand, if your prediction is wrong, the price hits \"stop loss\" and then you will suffer a loss.</string>

    <string name="s29_4">Maximum deviation between the final price and order price:</string>
    <string name="s29_5">The final price range:</string>
    <string name="s29_6">Notice:Setting a large deviation can make sure that you could open positions successfully during volatile price fluctuations.</string>
    <string name="s29_7">What is a pending order?</string>
    <string name="s29_8">“Pending order” means that users set a target price (limit price) in advance, then positions will be opened automatically at the target price or the next best available market price.</string>
    <string name="s29_9">Why do we need to set“deviation”?</string>
    <string name="s29_10">It takes little time to process pending orders. Sometimes, the market fluctuates faster than the system and market price diverges from the target price, hence the position may open at the next best available market price.</string>
    <string name="s29_11">In order to resolve the above issues, our system allows a deviation between the final market price and the limit price.The deviation is set by the user. In order to open positions successfully, users are suggested to set the deviation slightly wider. For example, if the target price of gold is 1352.25 , you set the “10 pips ”as deviations, then the position can be opened at the price of 1352.25-1352.35 according to the market condition.</string>

    <string name="s37_13">Trading Forex CFDs is purely currency speculation. Trading one currency against another in an attempt to catch the market movement correctly and have more cash in your Credit than you did before the trade. And just like  any other security, Forex CFDs offer a similar risk/reward ratio. The greater the market movement, the greater your profit or loss. Forex trading is mainly driven by economic reports, global events, or international political changes.</string>

    <string name="s37_45">XTrend Speed offers mainstream trading products that include foreign exchange pairs, metals and cryptocurrencies. And supports weekend trading.</string>

    <string name="s37_49">General trend since the opening of the day</string>
    <string name="s37_50">M1, H1, D1:</string>
    <string name="s37_51">The minute, hour, and day market trend chart.</string>
    <string name="s37_52">The left and right axes of the K-line chart respectively indicate the current price range of the symbol and the increase or decrease of the relative opening price.</string>
    <string name="s37_53">Each symbol has its own buying and selling prices. If you choose to buy, you aim to earn  profits by rising prices. If you choose to sell, you aim to earn profits by falling prices.</string>
    <string name="s37_54">The trading Specifications for all tradeable instruments can be simply understood as the units and specific quantities of each trading symbol.  The higher the specification, the higher the amount you plan to investment.  This will be based on your risk appetite, where greater the investment, the more you risk to lose, to potentially earn a higher return on your investment</string>
    <string name="s37_55">For example: if you use 1,000 USD and invest 2 lots of 500USD / lot, instead of 10 lots of 100USD / lot. You have decided to take higher risk of potential loses, in order to potentially make a higher return on your investment</string>
    <string name="s37_56">There are three specifications of 5, 100, 500 USD/lot on the XTrend Speed App, and a single order can be placed with up to 200 lots.</string>
    <string name="s37_57">View positions</string>
    <string name="s37_58">Profit/Loss = Price Difference in pips * Pip Value</string>
    <string name="s37_59">Stop loss is the maximum loss amount that the trader is willing to bear. Setting a stop loss in advance can avoid liquidation, protect funds, and reduce risk.</string>
    <string name="s37_60">You can set Take Profit in advance, which is the price you predict your trade to close at a profit.  When the market reaches your expected price, the position will be closed which helps you manage your positions efficiently and say goodbye to starring the market</string>
    <string name="s37_61">Pips represent the smallest unit of price fluctuations of the symbol.</string>
    <string name="s37_62">Example: When the direction is Buy, and the price of symbol rises more than a certain points, system will automatically close the position the desired level of $2000.</string>
    <string name="s37_63">The real fund trading is defaulted to holding positions overnight. XTrend Speed will charge a certain swap fee. You can click here to close it.</string>

    <string name="s40_70">It enables clients to replicate another trader’s orders and trading activity automatically. The social trading platform enables anyone to become a Master Trader and/or a Copy Trader, and even if you simply want to trade on your own – we will still make sure you have the best trading experience possible.</string>
    <string name="s40_71">Why Copy Trading?</string>
    <string name="s40_72">Simplicity: Using social features for trading assets online is intuitive, and easily accessible for both new and experienced users.</string>
    <string name="s40_73">Diversity: Diversity is key for lowering risk when trading. You can spread out your invested capital across various markets by copying different traders.</string>
    <string name="s40_74">Transparency: Exposing each trader’s orders, and track record, helps all XTrend Speed traders to make smarter decisions when choosing who to copy.</string>
    <string name="s40_75">As a Copy Trader</string>
    <string name="s40_76">Copy orders of Master Traders</string>
    <string name="s40_77">● “Copied Order” means Copy Traders copy the symbol and direction of the order Master Traders release, with the latest price.</string>
    <string name="s40_78">● Copy Trader can choose the specification, the number of lots, and set SL/TP themselves.</string>
    <string name="s40_79">● Before complete ‘About you’, copy trader can only copy 2 orders.</string>
    <string name="s40_80">As a Master Trader</string>
    <string name="s40_81">Release Orders</string>
    <string name="s40_82">● Clients can release orders if they meet the following criteria in the last trading week (including weekends):</string>
    <string name="s40_83">a) Number of Closed positions ≥ 3</string>
    <string name="s40_84">b)Total amount of Margin used on all opened positions ≥ $100</string>
    <string name="s40_85">c) Profit rate ≥30%</string>
    <string name="s40_86">● Cash orders with used margin over $40 can be copied by other clients.</string>
    <string name="s40_87">● The more copy traders, the more rewards they will receive.</string>
